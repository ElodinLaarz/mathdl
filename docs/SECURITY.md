# Security Documentation

This document provides information about the security measures implemented in this project.

## Automated Security Checks

Our CI/CD pipeline includes comprehensive security checks that run on every push and pull request:

### üîç Static Analysis

- **CodeQL**: Advanced semantic code analysis to detect security vulnerabilities
- **Semgrep**: Pattern-based static analysis for security issues
- **ESLint Security**: Custom security-focused linting rules

### üì¶ Dependency Security

- **npm audit**: Automated vulnerability scanning of dependencies
- **License compliance**: Verification of dependency licenses
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates for security patches

### üîê Secret Detection

- **TruffleHog**: Scanning for accidentally committed secrets and credentials

### üìä Security Reports

All security scan results are automatically uploaded as artifacts and can be reviewed in the GitHub Actions summary.

## Running Security Checks Locally

You can run the same security checks locally using these npm scripts:

```bash
# Run all security checks
npm run security:check

# Individual security checks
npm run lint:security      # Security-focused ESLint rules
npm run security:audit     # Dependency vulnerability scan
npm run typecheck         # TypeScript type safety check
```

## Security Features

### Type Safety

- **TypeScript strict mode** enabled for enhanced type safety
- **Runtime type validation** using Zod for external data
- **Comprehensive type coverage** across the entire codebase

### Input Validation

- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- Form validation using react-hook-form with Zod schemas
- XSS prevention through proper input encoding

### Authentication & Authorization

- Secure session management
- Principle of least privilege
- Protected routes and API endpoints

### Data Protection

- Environment variables for sensitive configuration
- No sensitive data in client-side code
- Secure HTTP headers configuration
